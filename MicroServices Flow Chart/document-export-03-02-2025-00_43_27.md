# Airline Booking

1. Different server for each service would be there, means different express apps would be there for different services, they would be communicating among each other.
2. API Gateway would be responsible for taking requests from the fronted and will resolve like this request is for search, or booking or anything else. Inside API gateway there are reverse proxies. This is also called frontend server.ï»¿
3. Reverse proxies are positioned in front of web servers to ensure the security of incoming data from external sources. It accepts and receives incoming traffic on behalf of clients.
4. You can also add authentication logic here, in case any request requires authentication like before booking you need that user should be auth then you can add that logic here.
5.  you can also add rate limiter in the API Gateway like in case you want to avoid requests made from the bots.
6. Orchestrators (optional) are used to avoid too much load on API gateways. They are used in very big applications like flipkart or linkedin. Like in flipkart, there would be many services and in this case there would be one orchestrator only for flight bookings, under which various services could be there and another for flipkart ecommerce bookings. 
7. sometimes API reqs can even bypass these orchestrators when needed. In our project, we wont use orchestrators.
